I love horror, specifically cosmic horror. I haven't gotten the idea of making a horror game
out of my head. So I'm taking some inspiration from various sources, perhaps some absurdist inspiration from 
Kafka and Camus and from Lovecraft's <em>The Alchemist</em>. 

The story takes place around the 1800s (I'm probably going to make historical inaccuracies).
Hopefully I'll be able to correct them all if there are any.

You play as an unknown investigator, who you are is still a WIP.
Maybe I'll add character creation in someway Ã  la Disco Elysium.

As of now I'm currently refactoring code and getting the basic of the game flow first before I implement more of the story.
Also I need to do grammar and spelling checks.

Either way the project is still forming and I hope to make an interesting yet fun experience.
Here's to a fun TextJam!
