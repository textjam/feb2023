<pre>been a long time since the last update (and this one is a day late!) life took over, and tiny text didn't ultimately reach the place I wanted it to. however, i'm proud of where it did manage to get to, and I might come back to it in the future. major changes since last time focused on proper scrolling. some features that didn't make the cut:

- proper keyboard shortcuts
- screen resizing
- code highlighting

feel free to download the repo and try it out!
