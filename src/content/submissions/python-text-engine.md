*WIP python text engine*

So far I have the following

- [x] A frame that acts like a container and binds everything together
- [x] A rectangular object that can be rendered on to the screen
- [x] A controller that can listen for keyboard events and updates objects accordingly.

Todo
- [ ] Add a collision detection system.
- [ ] Add more objects. *(Texts, Lines, and possibly polygons)*
- [ ] Add colors.
