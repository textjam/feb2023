title: start of the winter2023 textjam!
---

<pre>march 13th is already here, which means textjam is on the go!

we already have 27 members over on the <a href="https://discord.gg/m2VDZSqQwE">textjam discord</a>,
if you haven't joined yet, don't fret to hop!

some have already started on a base for their project

the site is also now much more than just one page, we have
a new updates section (what you are currently reading), and
a 'submissions' section, which has some example submissions
completed by some of the textjam organizers

if you have a submission you have started, but isn't finished
you can still submit it as a work in progress submission, so
other folks can check out what people are working on as they
work on it

i also hope to soon have a section folks can drop
their own devlogs onto this site as well alongside the
work in progress submissions
